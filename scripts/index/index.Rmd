## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Introductory Paragraph 
Our team is interested in exploring food insecurity to better understand the social factors influencing unequal access to nutritious foods in the United States. We are also curious about the success of food assistance programs across the US to learn if the overall goal of providing access to nutritious foods is being met. The data set we analyzed comes from research conducted by Feeding America, a nonprofit organization with a network of over 200 food banks. Feeding America drew local food insecurity and expenditure estimates from the Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). While we focused primarily on data from the most recent year (2018), Feed America provided 10 data files (for years 2009-2018) about food insecurity at the county, congressional district, and state levels. This data set helps our team better answer questions about the scale of American food insecurity and its financial needs. 

## Summary Paragraph 


## Table of Aggregated Data
```{r aggregated table}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
#Load data 
fa_2018 <- read_excel("DATA/Feeding America Data/MMG2020_2018Data_ToShare.xlsx", 
                      skip =1, sheet = "2018 State")
#Make table focused on the financial aspects of food insecurity 
financial_df <- fa_2018 %>% 
select(`State Name`,`2018 Cost Per Meal`, `2018 Weighted Annual Food Budget Shortfall`)  %>% 
 group_by(`State Name`) %>% 
  mutate(`Meals Not Consumed due to Budget Shortfall` =`2018 Weighted Annual Food Budget Shortfall`/ `2018 Cost Per Meal`) 
print(financial_df)
