## Food Assistance and Nutrition in the United States

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

Our team is interested in exploring food insecurity to better understand the social factors influencing unequal access to nutritious foods in the United States. We strive to do this by examining correlations between factors such as socioeconomic status, geographic location, education, and ethnicity. Additionally, our team is curious about the success of food assistance programs across the US. Because the implementation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) leaves room for state interpretation, the quality of accessible food through SNAP varies by state. We are interested in learning if the overall goal of providing access to nutritious foods is being met.

**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain?**

**1. Washington Food Distribution** ([link](https://nras.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b1ad1be260fe4ef8b877fc7064b0649f))

This ArcGIS map of Washington depicts the geographical distribution of all WA food assistance establishments, from food banks to tribal organizations. Each point on the map also provides contact, locational, and miscellaneous information about the establishment it represents.

**2. Washington State Food Security Survey** ([Study measures food insecurity in Washington families - WSU Insider](https://news.wsu.edu/2020/11/19/wsu-helping-washington-families-facing-food-insecurity/))

A joint study conducted by UW, WSU, and Tacoma Community College. This joint team, called WAFOOD Survey Team, conducted the first-of-its-kind state-wide survey about food insecurity in Washington, finding that 30% of WA households have experienced food insecurity ever since the stay-at-home order has been  implemented due to Covid-19 pandemic.

**[3. Northwest Harvest's Interactive Maps of Food Insecurity in Washington State](https://www.livestories.com/statistics/hunger-in-washington/washington/food-insecurity)**

Northwest Harvest is a nonprofit focused on supporting food banks in Washington state; their aim is to promote having access to nutritious food as a human right. Because of this, Northwest Harvest utilized public data to communicate the issue of food insecurity in Washington State. Their visualization shows data on the number of residents who are food insecure, have low access to grocery stores, and are receiving food assistance through Basic Foods (also known as SNAPs).

**[4. Fruit and Vegetable Incentive Program](https://www.doh.wa.gov/ForPublicHealthandHealthcareProviders/PublicHealthSystemResourcesandServices/Funding/FruitandVegetableIncentivesProgram)**

To incentivize nutritious eating, Washington State implemented a fruit and vegetable incentive program. With financial support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, SNAP users receive extra resources to spend on produce. These benefits apply to grocery stores and farmers markets state-wide.  


**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?**

  - Are certain geographical areas more prone to food insecurity/inequality?
  - Are there correlations between demographics and distance which affect access to food assistance?
  - How do demographics affect the _quality_ of food assistance (freshness, nutrition content, price, eligibility).
  - Is SNAPs goal of enabling families to purchase healthy food successful?
